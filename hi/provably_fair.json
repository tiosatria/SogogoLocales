This process is generally broken down into three steps: placement, layering, and integration. Placement: The process of placing unlawful proceeds into traditional financial institutions, through deposits or other avenues. Layering: The process of separating proceeds of criminal activity from their origin by layers of complex financial transactions, such as converting cash into traveler’s checks, money orders, wire transfers, letters of credit, stocks, bonds, or purchasing assets. Integration: Using legitimate transactions to disguise the illicit proceeds, allowing the laundered funds to be distributed back to the criminal; integrating the now clean money back into normal use.",
